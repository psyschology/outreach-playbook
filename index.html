I see you take orders directly through DMs/WhatsApp, which is great for connecting with customers!

My job is to help amazing businesses like yours streamline that process. I noticed a few quick ideas that could help you manage orders more easily and potentially reach thousands of new customers outside of Instagram.

Would you be open to hearing one or two of these ideas for free? No pressure at all.

Keep up the great work!</pre>
